# Security and Code Quality Issues

## Encryption Module Issues

### src/lib/encryption/core.ts
1. **Potential Timing Attack Vulnerability**
   - Line: `if ('timingSafeEqual' in crypto.subtle)`
   - Issue: Browser support check could leak information
   - Recommendation: Use feature detection with try/catch instead

2. **Weak Randomness in Test Code**
   - Line: `const testPassword = 'benchmark-test-password-' + Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);`
   - Issue: Using Math.random() for security-sensitive operations
   - Recommendation: Use crypto.getRandomValues() for all random generation

3. **Key Management**
   - Multiple instances of key export/import without clear memory cleanup
   - Recommendation: Ensure all key material is zeroed after use

### src/lib/encryption/fileEncryption.ts
1. **IV Generation**
   - Line: `window.crypto.getRandomValues(ivBuffer);`
   - Issue: IVs are generated correctly but verification is missing
   - Recommendation: Add IV validation before decryption

2. **Chunk Processing**
   - Potential for memory leaks with large file chunks
   - Recommendation: Explicit cleanup of ArrayBuffers after processing

### src/lib/encryption/textEncryption.ts
1. **Key Storage**
   - Device keys are stored as strings
   - Recommendation: Consider using Web Crypto's key storage mechanisms

## Authentication Component Issues

### src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
1. **Session Management**
   - Automatic session clearing on login page load
   - Issue: Could log users out unintentionally
   - Recommendation: Only clear session if explicitly requested

2. **Password Handling**
   - Password state remains in memory after submission
   - Recommendation: Zero out password state immediately after use

3. **Error Messages**
   - Generic "Invalid email or password" message
   - Issue: Could be more specific while avoiding info leakage
   - Recommendation: Differentiate between account existence and credential validity

### src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx
1. **Password Strength Validation**
   - Client-side only validation
   - Issue: Could be bypassed
   - Recommendation: Add server-side validation

2. **Password Matching**
   - Client-side comparison only
   - Issue: Could be bypassed
   - Recommendation: Validate on server

3. **Password Storage**
   - Password remains in state after submission
   - Recommendation: Clear immediately after use

## General Recommendations

1. **Memory Safety**
   - Add explicit zeroing of sensitive data after use
   - Implement secure memory management patterns

2. **Error Handling**
   - Standardize error messages to avoid information leakage
   - Add input validation for all operations

3. **Testing**
   - Add fuzz testing for authentication flows
   - Implement brute force protection tests

4. **Session Security**
   - Review session timeout policies
   - Implement idle session detection

5. **Password Policies**
   - Consider implementing breach detection
   - Add rate limiting for authentication attempts

## File Management Issues

### src/components/dashboard/FileCardActions.tsx
1. **File Download Security**
   - No verification of file integrity after download
   - Recommendation: Add checksum verification for downloaded files

2. **File Deletion Confirmation**
   - Uses basic browser confirm dialog
   - Recommendation: Implement custom confirmation with more context

### src/components/dashboard/ShareFileDialog.tsx
1. **Permission Management**
   - No validation of recipient email format
   - Recommendation: Add email validation before sharing

2. **Error Handling**
   - Generic error messages for share operations
   - Recommendation: Provide more specific error feedback

### src/components/dashboard/UploadDialog.tsx
1. **File Upload Security**
   - No file type validation before upload
   - Recommendation: Implement allowed file type restrictions

2. **Progress Feedback**
   - Simulated progress may mislead users
   - Recommendation: Use actual upload progress metrics

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Access Control**
   - Implement more granular permission levels
   - Add audit logging for file operations

2. **File Validation**
   - Add virus scanning for uploaded files
   - Implement file size limits

3. **User Experience**
   - Provide better feedback during long operations
   - Add cancellation support for uploads/downloads

## Critical Security Priorities

1. **Memory Safety**
   - Implement zeroing of all sensitive data (passwords, keys) after use
   - Add secure memory management for cryptographic operations

2. **Authentication Hardening**
   - Implement server-side validation for all auth operations
   - Add rate limiting and breach detection

3. **File Security**
   - Add file integrity checks for downloads
   - Implement strict file type validation for uploads

4. **Error Handling**
   - Standardize error messages to prevent information leakage
   - Add detailed audit logging for security events

5. **Dependency Security**
   - Audit all cryptographic dependencies
   - Verify WASM module integrity
